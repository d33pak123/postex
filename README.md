# 📝 Postex
Postex was born out of my reflections on the changing landscape of media consumption and sharing. I started this project to deepen my software engineering skills and to introduce a new vision for a social media, blogging, and news platform that prioritizes freedom of expression.

This platform is fully open-source, created for those who believe in the freedom to write and express opinions without interference. True self-expression in writing requires complete creative control, which is why Postex is designed around an editor that is simply a blank page, "The Canvas". Writers can freely design and structure their content using a highly customizable component system that no other service offers.

## 🚀 Features (In Development)
- Customizable writing blocks (text, images, videos, embeds)
- Drag-and-drop content editing
- Flexible layout system
- Collaborative editing (real-time collaboration)
- User mentions and commenting
- Subscription plans (support for independent creators)
